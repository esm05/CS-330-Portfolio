## How do I approach designing software?
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
New skills I was able to hone were clean code and commenting. Having the codebases shared between the various projects in this course allows me to stay consistent and organized with my complex and simple objects. As many of my complex objects had multiple objects to make it complete. New design skills include adding textures, material, and lighting to my scene, and hopefully, all the terminology will stick with me for future projects.
### What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process was to try to keep it realistic and when I was working on the project I had to have a window in my opposite monitor to see if it matched reality. This took a lot of trial and error as I was getting used to the API and my most obsessive dedication to making it as close as possible. I also worked on one complex object at a time to keep it simple it manageable.
### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Dedication to making scenes look realistic could be beneficial if I create videos or graphically design objects in a 3D modeling software that is more robust. Although I would prefer to use another API; I am glad I learned OpenGL in C++ since most of the concepts we learned are abstracted in other software.
## How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Since this is one of the few times that I had to manage a large project on my own keeping things modular and easy to follow was essential especially when incorporating lighting into the scene.
### How did iteration factor into your development?
As mentioned before my scene required a lot of trial and error or iterations to get the objects in the state I wanted. Even though that was the main reason for the iteration in the beginning I needed a lot of "runs" to understand how I just manipulated the object.
### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
The assignments that always was coupled with the project assignment gave me an example of how I should organize my code and good coding practices. An additional benefit of the modular design my skills scaled with each assignment resulting in the success of my final project. 
## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? 
The skills I acquired from this class enhance the importance of staying organized in a large code base. Especially being a software engineer I need to know the importance of this crucial step in developing professional code and for the projects I am going to be taking in my degree pathway.
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
This course equipped me with the skills that can hopefully be transferred to my professional life in my making graphics for a company or if I enter the field of video games I will be able to apply these practices.
